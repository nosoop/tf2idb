# TF2 Item DB

[Original plugin thread.][am-tf2idb]

Personal build, split off from FlaminSarge's version with the following tweaks:

* Support for differentiation between types of particles (weapon, cosmetic, taunt, etc.)
* Custom-defined capabilities for paintkit support and Australium
* Support for external scripting with file arguments and exceptions (traced to item defindex)
* No checking to see if the script works in Python 2
